Ket (Python)

************
Class
************

**Ket** is a class that maintains the information that corresponds with a single ket i.e. :math:`| 000..0 >` which would appear in the Dirac notation of a quantum state. A *ket* object understands how each unitary transformation affects its bitstring and complex coefficient.

Data
====

We use the string constants "0" and "1" to represent the computational basis states of the single qubit. These constants are declared in the *ket* package since it contains the lowest-level class which references the basis states. The local data for the *ket* package consists of these constants.

.. code-block:: python

    ZERO = "0"
    ONE = "1"

A *ket* can optionally be initialized with a complex coefficient and a bitstring value. However, these can be left empty at object instantiation and set later using *ket.set\_coefficient* and *ket.set\_val*.

In the spirit of object oriented programming, the *ket* class implements getters and setters. It also implements the supported unitary operators and a print function for readout.

The data local to a *ket* object are its bitstring value and a reference to its complex coefficient, which is an object itself. i.e.

.. code-block:: python

    val = "0000...0"
    coefficient = <Coefficient instance>


Methods
=======

**ket.get\_val (self) → (self.val)** is a method that allows for the retrieval of a *ket's* bitstring as a *String*.



**ket.get\_coefficient (self) → (self.coefficient)** allows for the retrieval of a *ket's* complex coefficient, which will be either an instance of the *Coefficient* class, or *None*.



**ket.set\_val (self, val) → (self)** sets a *ket's* bitstring to a given *String val* if :math:`val \in [ONE, ZERO]`.



**ket.set\_coefficient (self, coefficient) → (self)** sets a *ket's* complex coefficient to a given a valid instance of the *Coefficient* class.



**ket.get\_probability (self) → (probability)** returns the probabilistic weight of the *ket's* basis vector :math:`v_i` within its overall quantum state, :math:`|v_i|^2`. This method does not perform the calculation of this probability, but delegates that calculation to the public method of the *coefficient* itself *to\_probability*.



**ket.x (self, qubit) → (self)** performs a Pauli X gate on the target qubit by simply flipping the appropriate bit in the bitstring *self.val*.



**ket.cx (self, source, target) → (self)** performs a Controlled-X gate on the target qubit with the source qubit as controller. This is done by simply flipping the appropriate target bit if the control is equal to *ONE*.



**ket.y (self, qubit) → (self)** performs a Pauli Y gate on the target qubit by simply calling the methods *self.x, self.z* and *self.coefficient.multiply\_by\_i*.



**ket.z (self, qubit) → (self)** performs a Pauli Z gate on the target qubit by calling the method *self.coefficient.negate\_magnitude* if the appropriate bit in the bitstring *self.val* is equal to *ONE*.



**ket.h (self, qubit) → (self, new\_ket)** performs a Hadamard gate on the target qubit by creating a new *ket* object with the a bitstring *ket.val* and coefficient *ket.coefficient* which are copies of *self.val* and *self.coefficient*. Then, if the appropriate bit in *self.val* is equal to *ONE*, calls *ket.coefficient.negate\_magnitude* on the new *ket*.



**ket.s (self, qubit) → (self)** performs an S phase shift gate on the target qubit by calling the method *self.coefficient.multiply\_by\_i* if the appropriate bit in the bitstring *self.val* is equal to *ONE*.



**ket.sdg (self, qubit) → (self)** performs an S :math:`\dagger` gate on the target qubit by calling both the methods *self.coefficient.multiply\_by\_i* and *self.coefficient.negate\_magnitude* if the appropriate bit in the bitstring *self.val* is equal to *ONE*. *self.val*.



**ket.print (self) → ()** prints the *ket* by first calling *self.coefficient.print* and then printing *self.val* in Dirac notation.
